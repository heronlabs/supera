# CLAUDE.md — supera plugin repo

This repo **is** a Claude Code plugin. It ships skills + agents that run in *other* repos. Editing here changes behaviour everywhere supera is installed — treat it as load-bearing.

## Layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `package.json` | pnpm tooling harness (`private`, devDependencies only — no publish). The **version source of truth**; `plugin.json` + `marketplace.json` mirror it. Holds the `test:unit` / `lint:check` / `lint:fix` scripts and the npm `version` lifecycle hook. |
| `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | Plugin manifest (name, version). `version` mirrors `package.json` — synced by the `version` hook, never hand-bumped. |
| `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | Marketplace entry so the plugin is installable via `/plugin`. The `supera` entry's `version` mirrors `package.json` — synced by the `version` hook. |
| `tools/` | `sync-plugin-version.mjs` — fired by the `version` hook to surgically mirror `package.json`'s version into both manifests. |
| `tests/` | vitest + ajv schema tests: each schema compiles, `.claude/supera.json` and fixtures validate, the three manifests stay version-locked. |
| `.github/workflows/` | `ci.yml` (lint + test merge gate) and `cd-tags.yml` (release: bump, sync manifests, tag `v<x.y.z>` + floating tags, GitHub release). |
| `skills/` | `supera-init`, `ship`, `pr-watch`, `refine-ticket`, `audit` — each a `SKILL.md`. `ship` owns the full phase ladder (`fresh→scaffolded→building→built→pr-open→merged`), detected from git + tracker with no state file: re-run `/ship` to resume interrupted work or close out a merged PR, and `/ship pause` to checkpoint mid-flight. `audit` is the standalone auditor orchestrator — it runs the enabled auditors against a branch via its own worktree/PR, decoupled from `/ship`; ticket-less, and runs interactive or `--non-interactive`. |
| `agents/` | `supera-engineer` (the implementer), `supera-supply-chain-auditor`, `supera-freshness-auditor`. |
| `schema/` | `supera.schema.json` — the per-repo `.claude/supera.json` contract (**source of truth**, update before changing what skills read). `receipt.schema.json` — the `supera-engineer`→`ship`/`pr-watch` JSON receipt. `audit-receipt.schema.json` — the auditor receipt. |

## Core invariants — do not break

- **Nothing repo-specific is hardcoded in a skill.** Commands, the tracker board id, branches, remotes, and the tracker tool-map come from `.claude/supera.json` (read into `CONFIG` at the top of each skill). Tracker work is expressed as neutral ops (`getTicket`, `setStatus`, …) resolved through `CONFIG.tracker.tools.<op>` — never a hardcoded provider tool name. If you need a new repo-specific value, add it to `schema/supera.schema.json` first, then read it from `CONFIG`.
- **`supera-engineer` is the only implementer.** `/ship` and `/pr-watch` orchestrate and delegate; they never edit application code themselves.
- **Nothing commits to base directly.** Every skill works on a branch/worktree and ships via PR — CI is the gate on every change. There is no direct-to-base fast path.
- **One phase ladder, one owner.** The lifecycle (`fresh→scaffolded→building→built→pr-open→merged`) is derived from git + tracker — **no state file**. `/ship` owns the whole ladder and is idempotent: it resumes interrupted builds, opens the PR, and on a merged PR closes the ticket (status `closed`) + tears down the worktree. `/ship pause` writes the `wip:` checkpoint. `/pr-watch` drives the open PR green and hands merged PRs back to `/ship`. Status names are config-driven (`tracker.statuses` in the schema → `STATUS.<key>` in skills), never hardcoded.
- **Ticket-less is first-class.** Every tracker/timer step is guarded by `tracker.board` being set. New steps that touch the tracker must carry the same guard.
- **CI is the quality gate.** The engineer self-verifies as pre-flight; orchestrators do not run a full build/test/lint before pushing.
- **Schema and skills stay in sync.** A field skills read must exist in the schema with a description and default.

## Conventions

- Skills are config-driven and self-contained — templates are inlined, not cross-referenced via fragile paths.
- Keep `version` in lockstep across `package.json`, `plugin.json`, and `marketplace.json` (`package.json` is the source of truth; the `version` hook syncs the rest). The version-lockstep test guards this.
- Prefer adding a generalized agent here over copying a workloads-specific one — generalize across ecosystems (detect the manager, then act).

## Releasing a change

1. Edit the skill/agent/schema.
2. `npm version <major|minor|patch>` — bumps `package.json` and fires the `version` hook (`tools/sync-plugin-version.mjs`), which syncs + stages `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json`. Never hand-bump the manifests.
3. Commit (or let the `cd-tags.yml` workflow do the bump + tag + release in CI). Consumers pick it up on next `/plugin update`.

## Working with this repo (managed by /supera-init — edits between these markers are overwritten on re-init)

- **Edit, don't rewrite.** Change only the needed entry in a config/generated file (`package.json`, lockfiles, manifests, CI yaml); preserve the rest. Never regenerate a whole file to add one line.
- **No scope creep.** Build only what was asked; no speculative abstractions, layers, or options. Prefer the simplest working solution.
- **Ambiguous literals: flag, don't guess.** Config keys, IDs, and env names can be literal values, not mappings. State which reading you took.
- **Scope a change to where it belongs** — most changes are localized to one area; touch other repos only when the change genuinely cuts across, and then update the related repos too.
